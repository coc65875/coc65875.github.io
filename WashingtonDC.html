					<h2> Fun Facts </h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The DC War Memorial, which honors local residents of Washington, DC, is the only memorial dedicated to World War I on the National Mall. </li>
						<li>There’s a bathtub in the basement of the U.S. Capitol! Four marble tubs were installed in 1859 when most senators lived in boarding houses on Capitol Hill that had no running water so they came to work – and to wash. One of these baths can still be seen today.</li>
						<li> When the Washington Monument opened in 1884, it was the tallest structure in the world until the Eiffel Tower in Paris opened in 1889.</li>
						<li> The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world with more than 160,000,000 objects in its collection. The Library is based on the personal collection of President Thomas Jefferson, which contained more than 6,000 books.</li>
						<li> Visit the National Archives to see the original Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</li>
			 			<li>The Statue of Freedom is the bronze statue on the top of the Capitol dome. It looks small from afar, but it’s more than 19 feet tall and weighs nearly 15,000 pounds.</li>
			 			<li> The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is one of the National Mall’s newest memorials, having opened in 2011. The newest memorial is the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. </li>
			 			<li>Instead of chiseling the "F" in "future," the letter "E" was mistakenly carved into Lincoln's second inaugural address on the north wall of the Lincoln Memorial. It has been touched up, but you can still see the typo.</li>
